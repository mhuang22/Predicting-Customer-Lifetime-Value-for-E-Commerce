While active, the number of transactions made by a customer follows a Poisson process with transaction rate . This is equivalent to assuming that the time between transactions is distributed exponential with transaction rate λ\n2. Heterogeneity in  follows a gamma distribution with pdf\n3. After any transaction, a customer becomes inactive with probability p. Therefore, the point at which the customer “drops out” is distributed across transactions according to a (shifted) geometric distribution with pmf P inactive immediately after jth transaction\n4. Heterogeneity in p follows a beta distribution with pdf\n5. The transaction rate and the dropout probability p vary independently across customers\n\n#### The following nomenclature is used:\n\n**Frequency** represents the number of repeat purchases the customer has made. This means that it’s one less than the total number of purchases. This is actually slightly wrong. It’s the count of time periods the customer had a purchase in. So if using days as units, then it’s the count of days the customer had a purchase on.\n\n**T** represents the age of the customer in whatever time units chosen (weekly, in the above dataset). This is equal to the duration between a customer’s first purchase and the end of the period under study.\n\n**Recency** represents the age of the customer when they made their most recent purchases. This is equal to the duration between a customer’s first purchase and their latest purchase. (Thus if they have made only 1 purchase, the recency is 0.)\n\n**Monetary** represents the average value of a given customer’s purchases. This is equal to the sum of all a customer’s purchases divided by the total number of purchases. Note that the denominator here is different than the frequency described above.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Packages and Data Processing \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nimport datetime as dt\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-13T21:52:51.863277Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-13T21:52:51.863593Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-13T21:52:51.872285Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-13T21:52:51.863562Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-13T21:52:51.871137Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":74,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"customers_raw = pd.read_csv(\"../input/brazilian-ecommerce/olist_customers_dataset.csv\")\norders_raw = pd.read_csv(\"../input/brazilian-ecommerce/olist_orders_dataset.csv\", parse_dates = ['order_purchase_timestamp'])\norderItems_raw = pd.read_csv(\"../input/brazilian-ecommerce/olist_order_items_dataset.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-13T21:52:51.874309Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-13T21:52:51.874559Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.245906Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-13T21:52:51.874529Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.244977Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":75,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check the structure of the data\ncustomers_raw.info()\n# Inspect the data\ncustomers_raw.describe(include='all')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.247476Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.247808Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.546176Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.247767Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.545226Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":76,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"customers = customers_raw[['customer_id', 'customer_unique_id']]\ncustomers.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.547721Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.548070Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.562876Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.548026Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.562235Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":77,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check the structure of the data\norders_raw.info()\n# Inspect the data\norders_raw.describe(include='all')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.564892Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.565118Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-13T21:52:54.130189Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-13T21:52:53.565091Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-13T21:52:54.129355Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":78,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Filter orders by order_status.
